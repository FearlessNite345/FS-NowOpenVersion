- Added an option in the business directory to **close** a business without deleting it (works without a database).

- Added a new **EDIT MODE** in the `/openbusiness` UI to edit businesses you already own.  
- Introduced a **PRESETS** feature to save businesses as reusable templates for future use (does not require a database).  
- Tweaked various UI elements in the `/openbusiness` interface for a cleaner experience.
